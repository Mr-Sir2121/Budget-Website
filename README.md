# Budget Blueprint

A modern budgeting companion built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts. It mirrors the MATLAB planning worksheet while prioritizing delightful UI, real-time calculations, and local persistence.

## Features
- Multiple earners with historical paychecks, pay frequency conversion, and income-averaging.
- Rent affordability checker with 30% guideline, fair (income-based) vs. 50/50 split toggle, and verdict messaging.
- Fixed bills, groceries, gas, and adjustable savings/wants sliders with instant validation.
- Donut charts, grouped comparison bars, and 12-month savings plus debt payoff projections (with rolled-over payments).
- Inputs automatically saved to `localStorage` and reset controls to reload MATLAB-aligned defaults.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL to explore the budgeting dashboard. All data stays on your device; use the footer controls to restore defaults or clear saved inputs.
